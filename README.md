# Disaster-tweet-classifier-using-NLP


This repository contains code and resources for disaster tweet recognition using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not.
This can be useful in various scenarios, such as during natural disasters or crisis situations, where real-time identification of relevant information is crucial.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the data directory.
It consists of labeled tweets, where each tweet is associated with a binary label indicating whether it is disaster-related or not.
If you wish to use a different dataset, make sure it follows the same format.
